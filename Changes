0.121 Tue Sep 22 17:20:00 CET 2020
- Add new mouse method that does drag and drop using XTest mouse movement

0.122 Mon Sep 28 18:50:00 CET 2020
- Tests will skip when run as root due to root not being able to remove the X11 session created for the tests
- Additional waiting before opening new pages, this is to help stop issues with ajax requests coming through after navigating to a new page

0.123 Tue Sep 29 18:01:00 CET 2020
- Use Webkit2 decide-policy signal to make sure we do not navigate away from pages too quickly
- Injected JS for navigation is through anonymous functions to reduce the amount of global variables

0.124 Thu Oct 1 08:16:00 CET 2020
- error correction for tests when run as root. Use ok in wrong position

0.125 Mon Oct 5 13:15 CET 2020
- allow multiple concurrent navigations (can be caused by iframes) and turn die into opt-in warn

0.126 Tue Oct 6 11:00 CET 2020
- navigation requests to about:blank never properly finish and cause WebKit to hang

0.127 Mon Oct 19 10:00 CET 2020

0.128 Wed Nov 18 10:20:00 CET 2020

0.129 Thu Nov 19 14:00:00 CET 2020

- Improved cookie management using Webkit2s Website data manage and cookie manager

0.13 Fri Nov 26 16:17:00 CET 2020
- Sometimes errors captured in get_javascript_result were lost due to the use of a global variable.
- The value in the global variable is now stored in a seperate variable and output during its normal error handling.
- Updated name of test modules to be the correct ones rather than the Webkit1 names.
- Use Glib::Timeout instead of Time::HiRes to improve waiting times while while waiting for page updates.
- Wayland display will not be used if it is detected over Xvfb
